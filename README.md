Special CV project for programming course.Below you can see some screen shotes which represents current web site. 
CV web site contains three different pages , each of them accessible by three different routes on back end part. Home  
introduction page loads at the first entry. Others pages are for contacing with me and also just some brief informations
about my abilities. By using navigation bar it is possible to change pages with routes. 


Some of data maybe a little bit distored. The reson is not in web site. It is because of screen shooter application.
