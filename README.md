Special CV project for programming course.Below you can see some screen shotes which represent current web site. 
CV web site contains three different pages , each of them accessible by three different routes and supports three different languages on back end part. Home  
introduction page loads at the first entry. Others pages are for contacing with me and also just some brief informations
about my abilities.Client can leave brief information about himself in the contact page. File upload and email sending functionalities exist. By using navigation bar it is possible to change pages with routes.


This is ER diagram of my project. It contains two entities contact_infos and contact_responses. They have one to one relationship between them.
Since id number are derived attributes every time when we insert some new record id numbers are incremented automatically. By this reason I've decided to connect them via foreign key.

Some of data maybe a little bit distored. The reson is not in web site. It is because of screen shooter application.
